Ruby, Rails
---

This application started out using Ruby 2.2 Preview 1 and Rails 4.2 Beta 1.

`.ruby-version` and `.ruby-gemset` point to reasonable values. So when you have RVM, just...

```sh
rvm install 2.2-preview1
cd <repository>
bundle install
```

...and you're ready to run with `rails s`.

Test Suite
---

RSpec in `/spec` and Cucumber in `/features`. Run either one with its binary, or the suite with `rake` (it's the default task).

Used Tools
---

In addition to the gems in the `Gemfile`:
