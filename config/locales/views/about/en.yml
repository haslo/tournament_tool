        <h2>What is this?</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>A tournament management software for TOs - definitely for Android:Netrunner, but extendable (and will probably be extended early for X-Wing and MtG)</li>
          <li>An automatic pairing system for Swiss rounds and the cut to top X</li>
          <li>A mobile-friendly and showscreen-friendly ranking list and schedule view</li>
          <li>A little bit of an anonymized statistics view for TOs and interested parties</li>
        </ul>
